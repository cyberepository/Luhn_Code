# Luhn_Code

PART 1- VALIDATION OF LUHN CODE

The goal of this part is to create a program which verifies the validity of a Luhn code.
Your program should accept any given numbers after the ’-c’ flag and verify it’s validity.
You must display :
‘OK’ if the number is a valid Luhn code
‘KO’ if it’s not (on the standard output).
In case of an error (such as missing parameters, invalid flag, etc.),
your program should display a message explaining the error on the standard error output.

PART 2- CALCULATION OF LUHN KEY

The goal of this part is add a functionality to your program:
complete the code given as parameter.
More specifically, you have the complete the given number by displaying the missing digit.
For instance, in case of a bank number, you’ll be given the first 15 numbers and
you need to find and display the 16th number
